(Based on running python 3.8 on Linux, but any ver of python3 and Windows should follow roughly the same steps, Iâ€™ll highlight)

Dependencies:

Python3
pip
Open CMD/Terminal & install the following:

python3 -m pip install -U cryptography
pip install selenium
pip install pandas
pip install pyperclip
pip install regex
sudo apt-get install xsel (needed for pyperclip on Linux/Mac)

(If there are any other dependencies required just install them)

For Linux:
Download chromedriver and unzip it so you have the binary file

In terminal, type: mkdir //usr/local/bin/chromedriver
Then type,
sudo mv -f ~/chromedriver /usr/local/bin/chromedriver

You should be good to go!

To run:
python3 main.py
enter CIK codes separated by a comma
